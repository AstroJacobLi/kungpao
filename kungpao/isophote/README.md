# isophote 

* Modified version of https://github.com/ibusko/isophote by Ivo Busko
* Utilities for fitting and analyzing elliptical isophotes to galaxy images.

## TODO List: 
    
    - [ ] Understand the code, slightly different formats
    - [ ] Speed up the fitting process using JIT
    - [ ] More visualization tools 
    - [ ] Uncertainties from resampling
    - [ ] Extract profile within certain sector 
    - [ ] Multi-Gaussian Expansion of the 1-D profile
